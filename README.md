# Credit-score-classification
Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness. 
There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

1. Good
2. Standard
3. Poor
